# Sketch Box
This is a simple sketching program -- it consists of a grid of boxes that will change color on mouseover while holding left click. The user has the option to set the number of boxes in the grid, up to 100x100. The user can also change the color to any CSS supported value, a random color for each box, or a black/grey gradient that gets darker each time a box is activated.
